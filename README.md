Games with Friends

This page is created using React.

The purpose of this project is to have a way for my friends and I to play games together, or just figure out what game we want to play from our library.
It will contain a list of games each player has, with things like single or multiplayer, game genre, how many players if multiplayer, which platform it is on -PC or Console-, and which launcher it is on - Steam, EA games, etc.  I amy include a star list so if they really liked it versus something like, yeah, I own it but I don't really want to play it.

I am also hoping to include an ability to randomize the game list if you are not sure what you want to play.  You will have options to choose elements from the games like genre or single/multiplayer, or even none and then at the press of a button it will pop out a game from your list.  


The To Do List:

Login:

Add login screen for people to login - include name, discord id, possibly links to steam and other games for their apis to list games that way
Add game page to show list of games for each player
add game page to show list of all games for all players
add game add page to add new game for each player - maybe add it with the game list so you can see the list and add at the same time
include delete game so if it is entered in error or if they no longer have the game
maybe include if the game is installed vs. owned
a randomizer for when they want to play a game but don't know what they want to play
include a hey, let's get together page where a player can select a number of players, a list of games with that number of players will appear, then they choose the game
see if it's possible to ping via discord for the players from the let's get together page
